## Introduction
This project was part of the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The project was to design an entire webpage from scratch, getting it as close to the design and details files. I began with the HTML and then added the CSS to create the layout and apply the styles to match the design file. I also used CSS custom properties and utility classes to efficiently apply styles to a single HTML file.

## Motivation
I began The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations Course to review my knowledge of HTML and CSS skills. This project brought together both those skills and allowed me to use them to transform a blank webpage into a landing page.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
